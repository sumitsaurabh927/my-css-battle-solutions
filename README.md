## FAQ

#### Is this how you code in all your apps?

No. CSS Battle judges the submission based on the number of characters used. The fewer the characters, the higher you score. As such, it gives an incentive to not use comments (It actually says that in the instructions). This, hence, is not how I code in **real** apps. To see the quality of my code, please take a look at some other projects as this is not meant to be used as my coding standard benchmark. 

#### Can I participate in this too?

Yes, of course! Jump over to the website and code away. Don't forget share your progress on Twiter and tag me on [there](https://twitter.com/sumitsaurabh927) .


## Lessons Learned

- No Javascript at all.
- Also, I used as fewer characters as possible
